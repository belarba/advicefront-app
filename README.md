# Book Repository App

Test application for the position of Backend developer at Advicefront
(https://advicefront.com)

This app gets book information from the Book API and shows it to users in a Ruby on Rails app.

The following tasks need to be completed in the app:
1. There is an error listing books, find it and fix it
1. Implement book search in the index
1. In the list, instead of showing the book ID, we should be showing the book cover
1. Implement a simple show page showing all the information received about each book
1. Implement a contact form with two fields: email and message. After submitting the form the values inserted by the user should be shown. No emails should be sent. 

There are some conceptual errors in this app. Can you find them?s
